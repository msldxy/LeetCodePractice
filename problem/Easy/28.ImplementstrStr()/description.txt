Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

//题意解读：找出needle字符串在haystack中第一次出现的索引，如果没有出现就返回-1

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().
