    You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  
Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

    The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 //题意解读，这里有两个字符串J和S，第一个为不重复的，第二个为可重复的，长度最多均为50，且都是字母组成的。
 //要求为：计算出S中的字符在J中出现的次数，注意区分大小写。

   
    Example 1:
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

    Example 2:
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0

Note:

    S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
    The characters in J are distinct.
