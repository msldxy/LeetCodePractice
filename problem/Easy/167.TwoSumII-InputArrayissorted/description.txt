Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

    Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

//题意解读：对于一个给定的排序int数组，和一个目标值，要求数组中两个元素之和等于目标值的索引
//初步思路：依然使用双指针，一个头一个尾，相加与目标值比较，如果大了就将尾-1，小了就将头+1

Example:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
