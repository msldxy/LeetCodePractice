Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

//题意：给一个字符串的句子，将每个单词倒置，总体顺序不变
//思路：按照“”切分。然后每一个元素倒置

Example 1:

Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"

Note: In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string. 
//最开始没注意到这里，说的是所有单词由单个空格隔开并且没有多余的空格
