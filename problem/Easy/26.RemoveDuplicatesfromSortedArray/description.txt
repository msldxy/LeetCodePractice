Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

//题意：给一个排序的int数组，去掉重复的元素，得到每个元素只出现一次的数组返回长度
//要求：不申请额外的空间来创建数组，必须在本数组内通过改变得到
//解读：就是改变数组的元素，如果本来应该返回长度n，那么就应该跟原数组前n位一样
//思路：通过双指针，第一个遍历，第二个跟第一个不一样的话第二个就移位并把第一个的值给第二个


Example 1:

Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

Example 2:

Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
