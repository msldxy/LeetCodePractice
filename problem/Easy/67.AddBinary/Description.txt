Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters 1 or 0.

//题意解读：有两个代表二进制数的字符串，将其求和
//想法：将字符串转化为数组，分别对位相加最后再转换回来

Example 1:

Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"

Example 2:

Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
