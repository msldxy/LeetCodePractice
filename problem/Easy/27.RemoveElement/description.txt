Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.


//题意解读：给定一个int数组，还有一个value值，移除数组中为value的数。结果是返回一个长度，而且不额外使用空间，那么就应该是原来的数组，返回值应该就是代表的数组的前n位就是需要求的数组
//初步思路：使用双指针技术（双索引），一个快一个慢，快的将所有的都遍历，慢的将快的遍历得到与value不等的数重新放入数组中


Example 1:

Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

Example 2:

Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.

Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
