In a given integer array nums, there is always exactly one largest element.

Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array.

If it is, return the index of the largest element, otherwise return -1.

/*
*题意解读：给定一个数组，长度为[1，50]，每个数的大小在[0，99]
*要求：对于一个数组，会有一个最大值，如果最大值比其他所有的值两倍或以上，那么满足条件，返回最大数的索引
*如果不满足条件，则返回-1

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3, 6, 1, 0]
Output: 1
Explanation: 6 is the largest integer, and for every other number in the array x,
6 is more than twice as big as x.  The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.

 

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: -1
Explanation: 4 isn't at least as big as twice the value of 3, so we return -1.

 

Note:

    nums will have a length in the range [1, 50].
    Every nums[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 99].
