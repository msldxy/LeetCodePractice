Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum ≥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

//题意：给定一个有n个正数的数组和一个正数，求出数组中和大于等于该正数的最少元素个数
//思路：一个最简单暴力的方法，双循环，每次判断，将满足的长度存入数组，最后获取最小值

Example: 

Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n).
