# LeetCodePractice(Java)
## Background
 - I used to learn programming at university, but I didn't learn anything because I didn't take it seriously. Start learning Java seriously now.
## Introduction
 - This project is used to record the process of brushing questions in Leetcode.
 - There are three types of problems: simple, medium, and difficult. Under each topic, there will be an Description.txt that records the requirements of the topic and my own ideas. There is also a Solution.java, which is the submitted code, and there are also submitted results. If the algorithm is improved, it will be pointed out and implemented in the next java file like Solution2.java and Solution3.java and so on.
## I used to be busy for a long time,so it's hard to take the time to continue updating.Now I can try it.
